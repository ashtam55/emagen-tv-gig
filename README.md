## Executive Summary
This documentation is to serve as a 'Statement of Work' or SOW for edge devices to make the process of driv-thru be more automated and to trigger personalised ads using image processing. The advancement in the field of IoT, Networks, Computing and Data Science has made possible Integrated systems that can help business. Such a system would include a means to capture, catalogue and analyze data, along with tools to enforce 'business logic'.

Ashtam Singh will work with EmagenTV to:

* Develop on-ground edge devices.
* Develop Business logic for commincations with edge devices.
* Design a basic UI for the system. 
* Provide documentation of the new system.
* Knowledge Transfer/Integrate with EmagenTV.

Ashtam Singh proposes to design, develop and provide installation of v1.0 of the proposed system to EmagenTV.
This activity will require 4 weeks. The estimated cost for this activity would be $1120.

The Value Proposition of using Ashtam Singh for this project are:
* Proven engineering techniques for making Integrated systems.
* Leveraging our experience in working with IoT toolkit (ESP) to bootstrap your effort. 
* Using our subject matter experts to complete the project quickly. Rapid project completion minimizes disruptions and allows organizations to realize cost-saving quickly.

## Delivery Scope

* Project Definition
    - A review of the current system which helps in the integration of the on-ground edge devices.
    - A project kickoff meeting to discuss and document the complete scope of Software/Hardware for this transformation.

## Devices

* Car Tracking Device

Basic GUI for showing incoming request from Kiosk + an AV feed.

* Admin SDK / APIs for Devices
Native packages to interact with the devices. 

## Maintenance (if required)
The period after the development for maintaining the product to be discussed with the Client as it incurred extra charges.

## Exclusions
The followings are excluded from the project scope
* The packages used and maintained by Ashtam Singh for interfacing with IoT Devices.

## Deliverables
The deliverables are listed below.

* Software
Access top-level Git repositories for the software SDKs.

* Documentation and graphical depictions of the new proposed System.


## Customer Responsibilities
* The nature of this engagement dictates that Ashtam Singh receive a frequent and enthusiastic response from the appropriate personnel.
* A weekly review between the Ashtam Singh and the EmagenTV or his designate will ensure that the expectations of this engagement are met.
* Client will assign a key contact who will be responsible for providing Ashtam Singh with information, access to personnel, and facility access if required.
* Client will provide a work area space with desk, chair, Internet access for use by Ashtam Singh to conduct project business while working on-site.

## Investment and Cost
* Man-hour required: 4 weeks: 20 hours per week total of 80 hours

 * Payment Schedule

| Milestone                                 | Percentage    | Amount    |

## Acceptance Criteria
After this evaluation, all deliverables for this phase will be presented to EmagenTV for review.

EmagenTV or his representative will have three business days from the date of delivery of any document that is a deliverable to review it and request any changes.  If Ashtam Singh does not receive notification of any required changes within this period, the document will be deemed to have been accepted without modification and will be reissued as a final copy.

If Ashtam Singh is notified by EmagenTV, within the above time frame, of any changes required, Ashtam Singh will within two business days of such notification implement those changes as have been agreed between the parties.  A final copy of the document will then be submitted to EmagenTV.

## Assumptions
